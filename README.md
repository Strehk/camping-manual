# Camping Manual

A digital manual for camping procedures and guidelines, specifically designed for busy families with a caravan that want to stay on top of things in common szenarios (shoutout to my parents).

## About

This web application serves as a comprehensive guide for managing camping activities and procedures. It provides easy access to important information, step-by-step guides and checklists.

The idea behind the project is to provide a set of "missions" (e.g. "Starting a trip", "Parking the caravan", etc.) that have themselves a set of tasks/sequences that need to be done in order to complete the mission. These ever repeating tasks are then stored in a database and can be accessed by the user in a checklist-like manner with the ability to gather more information on each task if needed.

This project is a christmas present for my parents. 🎄


## Features

- 📱 Mobile-first design for easy access in outdoor settings
- 📋 Build comprehensive checklists for various camping tasks 
- 📖 Quick reference guides for common scenarios
- 🔍 Search functionality for fast information retrieval (soon to come)

## Language Notice

⚠️ Please note that this application is currently only available in German. Internationalization (i18n) support is planned for future releases but not yet implemented.

## Getting Started

Get in touch! Right now, this project is not yet ready for public use and very specificly tailored to my parents' needs. If you are interested in using this application for your own purposes, please let me know and I will provide you with the necessary information and support.

The application is built with the following technologies:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/)

The app is built to be deployed with two Docker Containers, one for the frontend and one for the backend. But one could easily build the frontend and backend separately and deploy them using other methods.
